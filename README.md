Quest Manager (QM) is a plugin that creates, imports, and manages quests on a Bukkit server.  Quests vary from things as simple as 'deliver this item to this npc' to as comlicated as 'kill this horde of monsters, fight a boss, and then have one member of your party be at each of these locations all at once' and on.
