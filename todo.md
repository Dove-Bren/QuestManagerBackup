QuestMananager TODO List
========================

<<< If you are unfamiliar with .md, I'm using the wiki page for it (wiki Markdown and you should get there). >>>

Listed here are some things that need or are wanted to be included in QM.  
Things that are needed before launch of the plugin, things that are needed for a successfull plugin, and things that would be cool all have an appropriate section.

Needed
------

### For Launch

+ Some standard for position data! Are people expected to put in the exact
  values for a specific location? This wouldn't be too bad, but we need a
  decision
+ Saving/loading quests, and their contained goals and requirements
+ Progress saving/loading on specifics like Boss Health, position, etc
+ Configuration definitions & standards

### For a complete QM

+ A nice party interface
+ Quest status delivery method (like text on the screen, scoreboard, etc)
+ The ability to drop quests


Extra Features
--------------

+ API capability (program your own very customized quests by getting API access
  to QM)
+ Visual information, like hovering text over monsters or party members, etc
+ A nice visual way of interacting with quest components, like clicking
  responses in the chat bar instead of typing in commands
