/**
 * A player skill. Skills can pertain to any aspect of the game, from combat to crafting.<br />
 * Implementations are responsible for catching events and acting on them. Implementations are <b>heavily
 * encouraged</b> to use the pre-built skill events rather than the bukkit ones, as they include the ability
 * to transfer information about success/failure between the potential many different skills that may
 * influence an action.<br />
 * While an implementation may override the level-up and experience-gain mechanics of a skill, prebuilt ones
 * are included in this class to allow a uniform config-specified skill experience. For more information, see
 * the {@link #perform()} method.
